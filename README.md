This repository corresponds to the LinkedIn Learning course "JavaScript Essential Training" by [Morten Rand-Hendriksen][instructor-profile]. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning][course-url].

## Overview

JavaScript is a crucial scripting language for the web, playing a pivotal role in the transition from static to dynamic web environments. This course covers essential JavaScript concepts through practical examples and mini-projects. Starting from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions, it progresses to advanced topics such as loops and DOM scripting.

Instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen guides learners with challenges to apply their newfound skills, fostering a hands-on learning experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains exercise files organized by chapters and videos. Each folder follows the naming convention `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`, where, for example, `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video within that chapter.

For movies with a distinct beginning and end state, the end-state is marked with an `e` (e.g., `02_03e`). This folder contains the code as it appears at the end of the respective video.

## Installation Instructions

To use the exercise files, ensure you have the following installed:

1. A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. [Prettier code formatter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4. [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

From the root folder, open the terminal and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
